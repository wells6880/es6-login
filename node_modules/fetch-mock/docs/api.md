## Mocking calls to `fetch`

#### `mock(matcher, response, options)` or `mock(options)`
Replaces `fetch` with a stub which records its calls, grouped by route, and optionally returns a mocked `Response` object or passes the call through to `fetch()`. Calls to `.mock()` can be chained. *Note that once mocked, `fetch` will error on any unmatched calls. Use `.spy()` or `.catch()` to handle unmocked calls more gracefully*
* `matcher`: Condition for selecting which requests to mock. (For matching based on headers, query strings or other `fetch` options see the `options` parameter documented below). Accepts any of the following:
    * `string`: Either
        * an exact url to match e.g. 'http://www.site.com/page.html'
        * `*` to match any url
        * `begin:http://www.site.com/` to match urls beginning with a string
        * `end:.jpg` to match urls ending with a string
        * `glob:http://*.*` to match glob patterns
        * `express:/user/:user` to match [express style paths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp)
    * `RegExp`: A regular  expression to test the url against
    * `Function(url, opts)`: A function (returning a Boolean) that is passed the url and opts `fetch()` is called with (or, if `fetch()` was called with one, the `Request` instance)

* `response`: Configures the http response returned by the mock. Can take any of the following values (or be a `Promise` for any of them, enabling full control when testing race conditions etc.)
    * `Response`: A `Response` instance - will be used unaltered
    * `number`: Creates a response with this status
    * `string`: Creates a 200 response with the string as the response body
    * `configObject` If an object _does not contain_ any properties aside from those listed below it is treated as config to build a `Response`
        * `body`: Set the response body (`string` or `object`)
        * `status`: Set the response status (default `200`)
        * `headers`: Set the response headers. (`object`)
        * `throws`: If this property is present then a the value of `throws` is thrown
        * `sendAsJson`: This property determines whether or not the request body should be converted to `JSON` before being sent (defaults to `true`).
        * `includeContentLength`: Set this property to true to automatically add the `content-length` header (defaults to `true`).
        * `redirectUrl`: *experimental* the url the response should be from (to imitate followed redirects - will set `redirected: true` on the response)
    * `object`: All objects that do not meet the criteria above are converted to `JSON` and returned as the body of a 200 response.
    * `Function(url, opts)`: A function that is passed the url and opts `fetch()` is called with and that returns any of the responses listed above (or a `Promise` for any of them)
* `options`: A configuration object with all/additional properties to define a route to mock
    * `name`: A unique string naming the route. Used to subsequently retrieve references to the calls, grouped by name. Defaults to `matcher.toString()`
    * `method`: http method to match
    * `headers`: key/value map of headers to match
    * `query`: key/value map of query strings to match, in any order
    * `matcher`: as specified above
    * `response`: as specified above
    * `repeat`: An integer, `n`, limiting the number of times the matcher can be used. If the route has already been called `n` times the route will be ignored and the call to `fetch()` will fall through to be handled by any other routes defined (which may eventually result in an error if nothing matches it)


#### `sandbox()`
This returns a drop-in mock for fetch which can be passed to other mocking libraries. It implements the full fetch-mock api and maintains its own state independent of other instances, so tests can be run in parallel. e.g.

#### `once()`
Shorthand for `mock()` which limits to being called one time only. (see `repeat` option above)

#### `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `delete()`, `head()`, `patch()`
Shorthands for `mock()` restricted to a particular method *Tip: if you use some other method a lot you can easily define your own shorthands e.g.:*

```
fetchMock.purge = function (matcher, response, options) {
    return this.mock(matcher, response, Object.assign({}, options, {method: 'PURGE'}));
}

```

#### `getOnce()`, `postOnce()`, `putOnce()`, `deleteOnce()`, `headOnce()`, `patchOnce()`
Shorthands for `mock()` restricted to a particular method and that will only respond once

#### `catch(response)`
This is used to define how to respond to calls to fetch that don't match any of the defined mocks. It accepts the same types of response as a normal call to `.mock()`. It can also take an arbitrary function to completely customise behaviour of unmatched calls. It is chainable and can be called before or after other calls to `.mock()`. If `.catch() ` is called without any parameters then every unmatched call will receive a `200` response

#### `spy()`
Similar to `catch()`, this records the call history of unmatched calls, but instead of responding with a stubbed response, the request is passed through to native `fetch()` and is allowed to communicate over the network.

To use `.spy()` on a sandboxed `fetchMock`, `fetchMock.config.fetch` must be set to a reference to the `fetch` implementation you use in your code.

```
    fetchMock.sandbox().mock('http://domain.com', 200)
```
Existing sandboxed `fetchMock`s can also have `.sandbox()` called on them, thus building mocks that inherit some settings from a parent mock

#### `restore()`
Chainable method that restores `fetch()` to its unstubbed state and clears all data recorded for its calls.

#### `reset()`
Chainable method that clears all data recorded for `fetch()`'s calls. *It will not restore fetch to its default implementation*

*Note that `restore()` and `reset()` are both bound to fetchMock, and can be used directly as callbacks e.g. `afterEach(fetchMock.restore)` will work just fine. There is no need for `afterEach(function () {fetchMock.restore()})`*

## Inspecting how `fetch()` has been called

### Filtering
Most of the methods below accept two parameters, `(filter, method)`
- `filter` Enables filtering fetch calls for the most commonly use cases. It can be:
    - the name of a route
    - The value of `matcher` or `matcher.toString()` for any unnamed route. You _can_ pass in the original regex or function as a matcher, but they will be converted to strings and used to look up values in fetch-mock's internal maps of calls, _not_ used as regexes or functions executed on teh url
    - If `filter` is a string, and it does not match any routes, it is asumed the string is a url, and calls to `fetch` made with that url are returned
    - `true` for matched calls only
    - `false` for unmatched calls only
    - `undefined` for all calls to fetch
- `method` A http method to filter by

#### `called(filter, method)`
Returns a Boolean indicating whether fetch was called and a route was matched. If `filter` is specified it only returns `true` if that particular route was matched.

#### `done(filter)`
Returns a Boolean indicating whether fetch was called the expected number of times (or at least once if the route defines no expectation is set for the route). _Unlike the other methods for inspecting calls, unmatched calls are irrelevant_. Therefore, if no `filter` is passed, `done()` returns `true` if every route has been called the number of expected times.

#### `calls(filter, method)`
Returns an object `{matched: [], unmatched: []}` containing arrays of all calls to fetch, grouped by whether fetch-mock matched them or not. If `filter` is specified then only calls to fetch matching that route are returned.

#### `lastCall(filter, method)`
Returns the arguments for the last matched call to fetch

#### `lastUrl(filter, method)`
Returns the url for the last matched call to fetch. When `fetch` was last called using a `Request` instance, the url will be extracted from this

#### `lastOptions(filter, method)`
Returns the options for the last matched call to fetch. When `fetch` was last called using a `Request` instance, the entire `Request` instance will be returned

#### `flush()`
Returns a `Promise` that resolves once all fetches handled by fetch-mock have resolved. Useful for testing code that uses `fetch` but doesn't return a promise.

## Config

On either the global or sandboxed `fetchMock` instances, the following config options can be set by setting properties on `fetchMock.config`
* `sendAsJson` [default `true`] - by default fetchMock will convert objects to JSON before sending. This is overrideable from each call but for some scenarios e.g. when dealing with a lot of array buffers, it can be useful to default to `false`
* `includeContentLength` [default `true`]: When set to true this will make fetchMock automatically add the `content-length` header. This is especially useful when combined with `sendAsJson` because then fetchMock does the conversion to JSON for you and knows the resulting length so you donâ€™t have to compute this yourself by basically doing the same conversion to JSON.
* `fallbackToNetwork` [default `false`] If true then unmatched calls will transparently fall through to the network, if false an error will be thrown. Within individual tests `.catch()` and `spy()` can be used for fine-grained control of this
* `warnOnFallback` [default `true`] If true then any unmatched calls that are caught by a fallback handler (either the network or a custom function set using `catch()`) will emit warnings
* `Headers`,`Request`,`Response`,`Promise`, `fetch`
When using non standard fetch (e.g. a ponyfill, or  aversion of `node-fetch` other than the one bundled with `fetch-mock`) or an alternative Promise implementation, this will configure fetch-mock to use your chosen implementations.

Note that `Object.assign(fetchMock.config, require('fetch-ponyfill')())` will configure fetch-mock to use all of fetch-ponyfill's classes. In most cases, it should only be necessary to set this once before any tests run.
